## Reply 1: ADU Height Limits Question

**Trigger post:** "What's the max height for an ADU in San Diego?"

---

It depends on whether you're in the City of San Diego or unincorporated county.

**City of San Diego:**
- Detached ADU: 16 feet max
- Attached ADU: 25 feet max
- Conversions (garage, etc.): height limits usually don't apply

**Unincorporated county:** Detached ADUs can go up to 25 feet, but there are nuances for accessory structures.

First step: confirm which jurisdiction your lot is in (city vs. county)—rules differ. The city's Development Services has info bulletins if you want the official docs. If you're juggling multiple properties, it helps to track which rules apply where.

## Reply 2: STR / Short-Term Rental Permit Question

**Trigger post:** "Thinking of listing my place on Airbnb in San Diego—what do I need?"

---

San Diego has the STRO (Short-Term Residential Ordinance). You need a license from the city, and there are tier/zone caps—some areas are already at capacity.

Steps:
1. Check if your zone still has permit availability
2. Apply through the city
3. Stay on top of renewals—expiration dates matter

The city publishes the STRO registry, so you can see what’s already permitted in your area. Worth doing this before you invest in furnishings or listings. If you want a quick way to monitor your permit status and renewal window, tools like DoggyBagg track this automatically.

## Reply 3: Code Enforcement / Citation Question

**Trigger post:** "Got a code enforcement notice—what do I do?"

---

Code enforcement usually gives you a timeline to fix the issue. Don’t ignore it; deadlines can lead to fines or liens.

Common causes: unpermitted work, trash/debris, overgrown vegetation, parking, noise. The notice should state the violation and deadline.

If you think it’s wrong, you can appeal—there’s a process. But respond by the deadline either way. Getting ahead of future filings is easier if you know when new activity shows up; some services monitor the city’s enforcement database and alert you.

## Reply 4: City Council / Ordinance Update Question

**Trigger post:** "Anyone know what’s happening with the new STR rules at city council?"

---

The city council dockets are published in advance. You can search for "STRO," "short-term rental," or "ordinance" to find relevant items. Meetings are usually Tuesdays; agendas drop a few days before.

If something affects your property, you typically have a short window (often 72 hours) before the meeting. Setting up a simple alert for relevant docket items can help you stay ahead instead of finding out after a vote.

## Reply 5: Landlord / Property Investor Question

**Trigger post:** "San Diego landlord—how do you stay on top of ordinance changes?"

---

It’s a mix of manual checking and tools. Key sources:

- City of San Diego Development Services (bulletins, STRO info)
- Code enforcement / seshat.datasd.org for filings
- City council dockets for proposed changes

The hard part is keeping track across multiple properties and not missing renewals or new filings. A lot of landlords use spreadsheets, but services that monitor these databases and send alerts can save time—especially for STRO renewals and code enforcement.

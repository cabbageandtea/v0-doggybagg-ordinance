## Instapage Patterns: What Works

| Pattern | Examples | Our Status |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Benefit-driven headline | Casper, Merrill Edge, Magento | ✓ "San Diego's Compliance Command Center" |
| Bulleted copy | Most top examples | ✓ Features, Why DoggyBagg |
| Social proof | Casper, Quip, Moz | ✓ Trust Bar, testimonials, stats |
| CTA contrasts with background | GEICO, Alexa, Datorama | ✓ Primary copper/amber on dark |
| First-person CTA ("Get My...") | Multiple | ✓ "Get My $499 Portfolio Audit" |
| Short forms | GEICO (1-field), Munchery | N/A – we use auth, not inline forms |
| Minimal footer | Moz, GEICO, Alexa | ⚠️ Our footer has many links (full site, not dedicated LP) |
| "Free" / "Now" in CTA | Many | ✓ "Get Started Free" in sticky |
| FAQ section | Quip, Cruise Zap | ✓ FAQ section |
| Privacy/trust near form | Several | ✓ Cookie consent, /privacy link |

## Debate Outcomes

### 1. Header CTA: "Get Started" → "Start Free"
**Verdict:** "Get Started" is generic (Instapage calls it "unremarkable"). "Start Free" emphasizes no cost and matches the sticky CTA. **Execute.**

### 2. Competing CTAs (Hero)
**Verdict:** We have Portfolio Audit (premium) + Book Call (secondary). Acceptable—different audience segments. Primary is visually dominant (glow-accent-intense). **No change.**

### 3. Trust Reducer Near Free CTA
**Verdict:** Instapage examples use "No credit card required," "Get started in 30 seconds." Add near Why DoggyBagg / Neighborhood Watch free sign-up. **Execute.**

### 4. Testimonial "4.9/5 from 200+ reviews"
**Verdict:** Article says missing review source can raise doubt. We have no public review platform yet. Safer to soften: "Trusted by San Diego investors" or keep. **No change** – don't add unverifiable claims.

### 5. Footer Link Count
**Verdict:** Dedicated landing pages benefit from minimal footer. Our homepage is hybrid (brand + conversion). Reducing footer would hurt navigation. **No change.**

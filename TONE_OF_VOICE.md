# DoggyBagg Brand Tone of Voice

**Core adjectives:** Confident. Clear. Human. Trustworthy. On your side.

---

## Brand Persona

DoggyBagg speaks like a seasoned San Diego investor who's been through it—someone who got burned, built the solution, and now has your back. We're **expert but not bossy, confident but not cocky**.

| Dimension | Our Position | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Humor** | Serious / straightforward | We don't joke about fines. We're direct. |
| **Formality** | Professional but casual | "We know this city" not "comprehensive municipal coverage" |
| **Respectfulness** | Respectful, not cheeky | We respect our users' stress and time |
| **Enthusiasm** | Confident, reassuring | We believe in what we do. No hype. |

## Do & Don't

### Do
- Use short, punchy sentences. One idea per line.
- Lead with the benefit: "Stop fines before they stop you"
- Sound human: "We're built by investors who got burned"
- Be direct: "No credit card required"
- Use "you" and "your" — we're talking to the investor
- Lead with facts over adjectives

### Don't
- Use corporate filler: "comprehensive," "robust," "solution-oriented"
- Hedge: "might," "could," "potentially" when we mean "does"
- Be vague: "industry-leading" without proof
- Sound salesy or use fake urgency
- Use jargon: "municipal code enforcement" → "city violations"
